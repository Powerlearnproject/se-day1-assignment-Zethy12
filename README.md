Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
-Software engineering is about designing softwares,apps,games and systems to make our lives easier.
-Software engineering is important in the technology industry as it makes our lives easier, as we are able to solve real life problems though technology and it brings fun and enthusiusm to people.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1)The NATO Software Engineering Conference(1968)- This conference marked the official birth of softeware engineering and led to the establishment of sotware engineering as a recognized disciple.
2)The Development of the Waterfall Model(1970)- This model was one of the first formal software methologies. It was developed by Winston Royce.
3)The Agile Manifesto(2001)- The Agile Manifesto signed by 17 prominent software developers, marked a significant shift in the software engineering paradigm.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1)Planning- Brainstorm ideas that solve a particular problem faced by target users.
2)Requirements- Interacting with stakeholders and users to collect and document project requirements.
3)Design- Creating the architecture of a software system and its elements.
4)Development- Building the software using a programming language by the development team.
5)Testing- Evaluating the quality of software with the aim of finding and fixing defects.
6)Deployment- Preparing the software to run and operate in a specific environment.
7)Maintanance- Updating and supporting the software after it has been delivered to the market.

Coampare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall methodology is a traditional, linear approach to software development.It is best for structured, stable, and well-documented projects. Whereas Agile methology prioritizes flexibility, customer collaboration, and adapting to changing requirements through iterative development cycles. 
Examples:
Waterfall: Developing a software system for a government agency with strict regulations and approvals.
Agile : Developing an AI chatbot for a company to help in handling customer queries.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software developers are responsible for designing, coding, and implementing software solutions based on project requirements. They write,test and maintain codes in different programming langueges like Python, Java etc. They debug and fix sofware issues.
Quality Assurance engineers ensure that the software meets quality standards by identifying bugs, testing functionality, and improving software reliability. They develop and execute test plans, cases and scrips. They also identify and report software defects.
The project manager oversees the planning, execution, and completion of software projects, ensuring they meet business objectives. They assign tasks, manage team workload and monitor project progress to make sure everything runs smoothly.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs play a crucial role in software development by providing a unified environment for writing, debugging, and testing code.
Example: Visual Studio Code and Eclipse
VCS is essential for tracking code changes, collaborating with teams, and maintaining a history of project revisions. It enables developers to revert to previous versions, merge changes, and work simultaneously without overwriting each other's work. 
Examples: Github and Git

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
1. Debugging and Fixing Bugs, it can be difficult finding errors in your code and also fixing some of them.
   So the best way to do it, is if we use debugging tools like GDB (for C/C++), PDB (for Python), or IDE-integrated debuggers. Implement logging and write unit tests to catch errors early.
2. Meeting Project Deadlines
   So it's best if we use Agile methodologies like Scrum to break projects into manageable tasks. Prioritize features using the MoSCoW method (Must-have, Should-have, Could-have, Won't-have).Also using methods like Trello to keep track of the progress.
   

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit Testing – the smallest possible part of a system called a unit is tested individually and independently.
Unit testing is important because it helps detect bugs early in development, making it easier to identify and fix errors before they affect other parts of the system. 
Integration Testing – tests how components of a system interact with each other .
Integration testing plays a vital role in ensuring that different software components work together seamlessly. Since modern applications rely on multiple modules, APIs, and external services, integration testing helps uncover communication issues between these components.
System Testing (end-to-end) – tests an entire system.
System testing is essential because it validates the complete software application to ensure it meets all functional and non-functional requirements. This type of testing helps detect issues that may not have been caught during unit or integration testing.



#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is a way of communicating with the AI,giving commands to the AI and it responding to your commands.
It is important because it helps optimize AI interactions, ensuring accurate, relevant, and efficient responses.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Example: Tell me about the weather.
Improved one: What is the weather for Durban tomorrow?
The first prompt is  unclear whether the user wants current, future, or general weather information whereas the improved one is specific which helps in generating a more relevant and accurate response.
